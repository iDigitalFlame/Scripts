# Golang Scripts

Each script is hosted in it's own directory for easier management (technically how
Go manages single script files).

## Contents

- *AppXPruner*: Removes a list of defined AppX Packages
- *FilePrune*: Automatically prunes files based on their timestamps
- *GroupHelper*: Switch to a group to help "containerize" applications or give them separate permissions
- *Motivate*: Displays quotes and stuff
- *WebScan*: Web-based network scanning
