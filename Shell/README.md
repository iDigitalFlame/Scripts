# Shell Scripts

Simple and small Shell scripts that I find useful.

## Contents

- *decrypt.sh*: Decrypts an "aes-256-cbc" encrypted file using openssl.
- *encrypt.sh*: Encrypts a file using "aes-256-cbc" using openssl.
- *pfx2pem.sh*: Converts a ".pfx" file to a PEM and Key file usable for Linux.
