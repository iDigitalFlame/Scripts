# Scripts and Code Snippets

This repository contains some code and tools that I have created over the years to help automate and
improve some processes.

Some of them are exploits but don't exactly fit in https://github.com/iDigitalFlame/redteam-tools
The rest of the tools are broken up by languages.

Don't use it to break other people's stuff. Legal use only please.
I am NOT responsible for what you do to your (or anyone elses's) systems.
